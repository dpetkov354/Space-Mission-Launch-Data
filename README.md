Space Mission Launch Data ETL and Dashboarding

This project provides a comprehensive solution for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) space mission launch data into a structured format, followed by interactive dashboarding for insightful data visualization and analysis.

Key Features: -ETL Pipeline: Automated pipelines to extract raw space mission launch data from various sources, transform it into a clean, normalized format, and load it into a database or data warehouse. -Data Sources: Integration with APIs, CSV/JSON files, or web scraping for acquiring launch data. -Data Processing: Includes preprocessing steps such as deduplication, handling missing values, data enrichment, and validation. -Dashboarding: Interactive dashboards with rich visualizations for exploring launch history, success rates, rocket types, mission types, and more. -Scalability: Modular architecture for easy expansion, enabling support for additional data sources or visualization tools. -Technology Stack: Built using Python for ETL, with support for tools like Pandas, PostgreSQL. Dashboards are powered by tools such as Tableau.

Use Cases: -Historical Analysis: Explore historical trends in space missions across different agencies, rockets, and outcomes. -Insights for Researchers: Enable researchers to analyze space exploration trends, failures, and successes. -Decision Support: Provide actionable insights for space agencies and organizations involved in mission planning.
